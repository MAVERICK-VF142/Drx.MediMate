## üìÇ Project Structure

The project now follows a modular Flask application structure, enhancing maintainability, scalability, and clarity. Key directories and their responsibilities are:

-   **`app/`**: Contains the core Flask application logic.
    -   `__init__.py`: Initializes the Flask app and registers the main application components.
    -   `config.py`: Manages application-wide settings and environment configurations.
    -   `models.py`: (Currently empty) Reserved for future database model definitions.
    -   **Blueprints (Feature Modules):** Each main feature is organized into its own Blueprint sub-directory:
        -   `drug_info/`: Handles routes and logic for retrieving and displaying drug information using Gemini AI.
        -   `image_processing/`: Manages routes and services for uploading and analyzing medicine images with Gemini Vision AI.
        -   `main/`: Contains general application pages, including the homepage and dashboard routes.
        -   `symptom_checker/`: Manages routes and logic for providing symptom-based drug recommendations via Gemini AI.
    -   `utils/`: Houses reusable helper functions, like API response formatting.
-   **`static/`**: Stores static web assets such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.
-   **`templates/`**: Contains all HTML templates, organized into subdirectories (e.g., `main/`, `drugs/`) that correspond to application features.
-   **`tests/`**: (If applicable) Contains automated tests for the application.
-   **`venv/`**: The Python virtual environment for isolated dependencies.
-   **`.env`**: (Ignored by Git) Used for local environment variables like API keys.
-   **`wsgi.py`**: The main entry point for running the Flask application.
-   `Procfile`, `vercel.json`, `requirements.txt`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`: Other standard project files.
